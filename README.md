## Description 
Welcome to our learning portal! Our platform is designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience for both Students and Admins. With our easy-to-use interface, Admins can add educational content such as videos, quizzes, and assignments. Students can then access this content and submit their work for assessment. Our platform allows for dynamic calculation of quiz results, while the Admins can mark the assignments and provide feedback. Students can view their progress on the Leaderboard, where they can see their own and other Students' marks. We strive to provide a collaborative and engaging learning environment that encourages growth and development.

This learning portal has two types of users: Students and Admins. The Admin can add videos, create quizzes, and create assignments. Students can view the videos, submit quizzes, and assignments. The quizzes are dynamically calculated as correct or incorrect, while the Admin marks the assignments and the marks are displayed on the Dashboard. The Students can see their own and other Students' marks for the assignments on the Leaderboard.
